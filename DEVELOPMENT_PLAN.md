# Development Plan: Healthcare Integration Engine (Inspired by Mirth Connect)

## 1. Project Goal
To develop a flexible and extensible healthcare integration engine, similar to Mirth Connect, capable of facilitating secure and efficient data exchange between disparate healthcare systems. The engine will focus on message filtering, transformation, extraction, and routing to enable seamless information flow.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Connector Management
*   Define and manage various types of data source/destination connectors (e.g., File, HTTP, Database, HL7, FHIR).
*   Configuration interface for each connector type.

### 2.2. Message Processing Pipeline
*   **Message Ingestion:** Receive messages from configured input connectors.
*   **Message Filtering:** Implement rules to filter messages based on content, metadata, or other criteria.
*   **Message Transformation:** Provide tools for transforming messages between different formats (e.g., HL7 to JSON, XML to FHIR, custom formats).
*   **Message Routing:** Configure rules to route processed messages to appropriate output connectors based on defined logic.
*   **Message Output:** Send transformed messages to configured output connectors.

### 2.3. Data Persistence
*   Store message logs, processing history, and configuration data.
*   Support for auditing and traceability of message flow.

### 2.4. Monitoring & Logging
*   Real-time monitoring of message flow and system health.
*   Comprehensive logging of all processing steps, errors, and warnings.
*   Alerting mechanisms for critical events.

### 2.5. User Interface (Web-based)
*   Intuitive dashboard for overall system status.
*   Configuration interfaces for connectors, filters, transformations, and routing rules.
*   Message browser for viewing historical messages and logs.
*   User management and access control.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI, SQLModel) - leveraging existing `LingShu-backend` structure.
    *   Potential addition: Message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing and scalability.
*   **Frontend:** React (with Material Design principles) - leveraging existing `LingShu-frontend` structure.
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development/small deployments), PostgreSQL (recommended for production).
*   **Messaging/Integration:**
    *   Custom parsers/serializers for healthcare standards (HL7, FHIR, DICOM - as scope expands).
    *   Templating engine (e.g., Jinja2) for flexible transformations.

## 4. Phased Development

### Phase 1: Core Message Processing (MVP)
*   **Backend:**
    *   Basic connector framework (e.g., File System input/output).
    *   Simple message passthrough logic.
    *   Initial message logging to the database.
    *   API endpoints for basic connector configuration.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Minimal UI for listing and configuring basic file connectors.
    *   Basic dashboard showing active connectors.

### Phase 2: Filtering and Transformation
*   **Backend:**
    *   Implement message filtering logic (e.g., based on simple regex or JSONPath).
    *   Develop a basic message transformation engine (e.g., using Python scripting or Jinja2 templates).
    *   Extend API for defining filters and transformations.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   UI for defining and applying message filters.
    *   UI for creating and managing message transformation templates.

### Phase 3: Advanced Connectors and Routing
*   **Backend:**
    *   Add more connector types (e.g., HTTP Listener/Sender, Database Reader/Writer).
    *   Implement advanced routing rules (e.g., conditional routing based on message content).
    *   Integrate with a message queue for robust asynchronous processing and error handling.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   UI for configuring new connector types.
    *   UI for defining complex routing logic.

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Management
*   **Backend:**
    *   Develop comprehensive monitoring endpoints for message queues, connector status, and processing metrics.
    *   Implement user authentication and authorization.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Detailed monitoring dashboards (message throughput, error rates).
    *   User management interface.
    *   Alerting configuration.

### Phase 5: Healthcare Standards Support (Future Expansion)
*   **Backend:**
    *   Implement robust parsers and serializers for HL7 v2, FHIR, and potentially DICOM.
    *   Provide pre-built templates and mappings for common healthcare message transformations.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Specialized UI components for configuring HL7/FHIR specific transformations.

## 5. Testing Strategy
*   **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests for all backend logic (API endpoints, message processing components, database interactions) and frontend components.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components (e.g., connector to message processor, processor to database).
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate full message flows from ingestion to output, verifying data integrity and correct routing.

## 6. Deployment Considerations
*   **Containerization:** Dockerize both the backend and frontend applications for easy deployment and portability.
*   **Orchestration:** Utilize Docker Compose for local development and potentially Kubernetes for scalable production deployments.
*   **Configuration Management:** Externalize configuration (e.g., environment variables, `.env` files) for different environments.
